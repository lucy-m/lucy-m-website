          <p>
            I am a front-end software developer who loves functional
            programming, test-driven development, and architectural design. I am
            enthusiastic about producing aesthetically pleasing yet functional
            web apps that people are delighted to use. I am also keen on sharing
            knowledge and helping to upskill others via mentoring, workshops,
            and conference talks.

                I joined Codat as a mid-level front-end engineer and moved up to
                a senior role after a year. The majority my time here was spent
                using React and TypeScript.
              </p>
              <p>Highlights include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Architecting libraries and apps for front-end to maximise ease
                  of testing and to leverage the TypeScript compiler as much as
                  possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Introducing Cypress testing and showing how to use it for
                  test-driven development. Advocating for the end of snapshot
                  testing. Generally talking about testing too much.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fixing webpack issues, mostly related to style loading with
                  micro front ends and content security policies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mentoring colleagues, helping them to upskill and become more
                  confident. I helped a technical writer transition to a junior
                  developer role and mentored two graduate developers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Introducing Svelte as an alternative to React when building a
                  library to allow our clients to embed our app into their
                  sites.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Running an F# programming group for my fellow functional
                  programming fans. We built a virtual coffee break app that
                  integrates with Google calendar and Slack.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Working with product and design to ensure features were
                  sensibly scoped and designs were complete and feasible before
                  starting work.
                </li>
                <li>Contributing to our internal component library.</li>

                I joined G-Research's graduate scheme as a full-stack developer
                to work on apps for monitoring and controlling a trading
                platform. I primarily worked with C# with ASP.NET and Angular
                and I was exposed to many other related technologies, such as
                using Kubernetes to manage our infrastructure, and using ELK
                stack for structured logging.
              </p>
              <p>
                Throughout my time, I transitioned to a more front-end role and
                I took on more user-facing responsibilities, such as organising
                our app backlogs and scoping out new features. I was a keen
                member within the UI developer group and often helped other
                teams with front-end development questions.

                I completed six months of a part-time course on graphic design
                at Shillington to get more experience in design, particularly in
                a digital setting. As part of this course, I was exposed to a
                wide range of different areas of graphic design, including
                posters, flyers, websites, and mobile apps. This course used
                Adobe Creative Cloud (such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and
                InDesign) and Figma.

                Systems Biology is an inter-disciplinary subject, looking at how
                mathematics and computer science can be applied to biological
                problems, such as DNA sequencing. During this course, I had to
                collaborate with students from different backgrounds. My fourth
                year project involved using linear programming to compute
                elementary flux modes.

                My third year project for my degree involved looking at how
                information in a languageâ€™s interpreter could be used to suggest
                corrections to syntax errors. In the case of an error, my
                project would use the interpreterâ€™s rules to suggest
                corrections, such as inserting a missing parenthesis or colon.
                My project used python and was aimed at, and tested by, novice
                programmers.
